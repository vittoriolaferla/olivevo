## Project Overview

Our primary goal is to create a user-friendly platform for purchasing extra virgin olive oil that helps customers make informed product choices. However, our project goes beyond that and aims to interconnect customers, retailers, and producers, taking the extra virgin olive oil market from a local to a global dimension.

### Key Project Features

- **Flutter Framework**: The backbone of Olioevo, providing a cross-platform foundation that ensures a smooth, responsive user interface across all devices.

- **Dialogflow Integration for AI-Powered Assistance**: Leveraging Google's Dialogflow, Olioevo offers real-time, conversational AI support. Our virtual assistants guide users through the product selection process, answer queries, and enhance overall customer service.

- **Custom API for WooCommerce Integration**: To streamline product management and e-commerce operations, we've developed a custom API that interfaces with WooCommerce. This setup not only enriches our product catalog but also secures transaction processes, making shopping reliable and hassle-free.

- **PayPal for Secure Payments**: Recognizing the importance of secure and convenient payment methods, Olioevo integrates PayPal, enabling swift, safe transactions for customers worldwide.

- **Enhanced Product Interaction through flutter_barcodescanner**: By incorporating the flutter_barcodescanner library, we've added a layer of interactivity to the shopping experience. Customers can scan olive oil bottle labels for instant access to detailed product insights, fostering an informed purchasing decision.
